We'll build a flow for the Contoso event team that automatically pulls customer email addresses from a Microsoft Excel workbook on Microsoft OneDrive. 

We'll then set up the flow so that any email addresses that anyone adds to the workbook will receive an event information email once a day.

   ### Prerequisites
For this scenario, youâ€™ll need to make an Excel file with a table that contains the following columns: ContactEmail, FirstName, and LastName. Save the Excel file in OneDrive for Business. You'll connect to this file in step 9. Use your organization email address as the ContactEmail, using your email will make testing the flow easier.
