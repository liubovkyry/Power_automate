## Build a flow that uses information like locations or date

You can build instant flows that use information like Global Positioning System (GPS) data, date information, or email. This information is available as trigger tokens. Trigger tokens are data points that are known and available to the device that an instant flow is running on. These tokens change, based on factors like the current time or the current geographic location of the device.

For example, if you run an instant flow on a phone, the phone probably knows the time at your current location, the date, and your current address. In other words, the time and date, and the address where the phone is located, are determined when the instant flow runs. They're automatically available for use in any instant flows that are run on the device.

You can use these trigger tokens to build useful flows that minimize repetitive tasks. Such tasks include providing your location to someone or tracking how much time you spent on a particular job or service call.
