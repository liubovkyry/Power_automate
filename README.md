# Introductio to Power automate
Objectives will include:

 * Describing the different types of flows
 * How to identify and choose the proper type of flow triggers
 * How to find and use templates to run or modify a flow
 * How to use data connectors and how to change them
 * Be able to describe templates, connectors, loops and conditions, expressions, and approvals
 * And finally, create and modify a flow
   
Power Automate can connect to a wide variety of applications within Microsoft, and outside. Here are some examples of what Power Automate can accomplish.

 * Press a button on your mobile phone to check the weather or your GPS location and bring up a map
 * Update your social media from a pre-approved SharePoint list of future posts
 * Run complex approval workflows combined with forms, documents, and notifications
 * Move documents that meet a certain criteria to another location with more storage space
 * Output items from a form to a SharePoint list or Excel Spreadsheet
 * And Flag a quality issue to shut down production across the world. Notify all production managers and require a mitigation form be filled out before resuming production

## Identifying Flow Types

 In Power Automate we have three types of flows we can use to accomplish our automations. 

 So we head into Power Automate and on the left-hand menu, we choose My flows. Cloud Flows. 
 The first of these flows is what we would call event-driven, triggered flows, or you'll see them listed as cloud flows.
 Within the cloud flows, there are three more types. These types really indicate the type of activation of the cloud flow.

 <b>An Automated flow</b> is a flow that is triggered based on some criteria. For instance, if a SharePoint list item is updated the flow will start, or when an email is received, the flow starts.

<b>Instant flows</b> are the type that you can start with a button. This button could be attached to a web page or used within a cell phone Power Automate app. 

<b>Scheduled flows</b> are the type that run based on a specific schedule, like once per day or once a week, they might start up to remind somebody of something or run a process that needs to be done every week.

<b>Desktop</b> or <b>Robotic Process Automation (RPA)</b> flows are automations that you create for your desktop or for using the web. They are created in another interface on your desktop and saved in the cloud. A good example might be starting up your web browser and opening a page of that website to keep up to date on new additions.
